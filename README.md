Paw Wash was designed during the Hack the Crisis Finland online hackathon (20-22.3.2020) to help counter the COVID-19 pandemic, the software is specifically intended for restaurant staff and kids to routinely remember washing hands. Users are able to record when their hands were washed, the surpervisors can easily access the complete record with one click, and the interval of reminders can be set from 5 to 60 minutes.
